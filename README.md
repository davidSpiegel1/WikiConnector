## Installation
Simply clone the most recent version. Run the ``main.py`` file within the ``src`` directory.

## How It Works
* Makes API calls that are dependent on the _connector_ that is being used.
* Utilizes a CSV file to aggregate data that is treated as a temporary database.
* Queries this file using a query language developed by myself.

## Updates
* added a query editor to the application
* Made the readme
