TITLE: Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database 2014,PAGEID: 1a7dfa2a-2de9-eb11-bacb-000d3a5aa7a5,SNIPPET: Financial inclusion is critical in reducing poverty and achieving inclusive economic growth. When people can participate in the financial system, they are better able to start and expand businesses, invest in their children’s education, and absorb financial shocks. Yet prior to 2011, little was known about the extent of financial inclusion and the degree to which such groups as the poor, women, and rural residents were excluded from formal financial systems. <br><br>By collecting detailed indicators about how adults around the world manage their day-to-day finances, the Global Findex allows policy makers, researchers, businesses, and development practitioners to track how the use of financial services has changed over time. The database can also be used to identify gaps in access to the formal financial system and design policies to expand financial inclusion.
TITLE: Viet Nam - Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database 2011,PAGEID: 52ab5561-6f0c-ec11-b6e6-000d3a5bda46,SNIPPET: Well-functioning financial systems serve a vital purpose, offering savings, credit, payment, and risk management products to people with a wide range of needs. Yet until now little had been known about the global reach of the financial sector - the extent of financial inclusion and the degree to which such groups as the poor, women, and youth are excluded from formal financial systems. Systematic indicators of the use of different financial services had been lacking for most economies. <br><br>The Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) database provides such indicators. This database contains the first round of Global Findex indicators, measuring how adults in more than 140 economies save, borrow, make payments, and manage risk.  The data set can be used to track the effects of financial inclusion policies globally and develop a deeper and more nuanced understanding of how people around the world manage their day-to-day finances. By making it possible to identify segments of the population excluded from the formal financial sector, the data can help policy makers prioritize reforms and design new policies.
TITLE: Global Subnational Poverty Atlas (GSAP),PAGEID: ad1fac91-0bcd-eb11-bacc-000d3a596ff0,SNIPPET: <p>This data entry includes lined-up subnational poverty estimates (based on international poverty line(s)) in 2019 for more than 168 economies at the administrative unit level 1. Administrative unit level 1 refers to the highest subnational unit level (examples include ‘state’, ‘governorate’, ‘province’) from household surveys.</p><p><br></p><p>In 2013, the World Bank announced the goals of fighting poverty in all its forms by 2030 and promoting shared prosperity. Despite a remarkable progress made on reducing poverty in recent years, reaching the targets remains challenging. The decline in poverty has been uneven. The poverty reduction in recent years was dominated by the East Asia and Pacific (notably China and Indonesia) and South Asia (notably India) (World Bank, 2017). Despite the progress made so far, the number of extreme poor remains high, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. In many countries, vast differences in poverty levels persist at the subnational level. In addition, global problems such as climate change, fragility, economic crises and food security pose great risks for poverty reduction, and they are often trans-border issues, which generate strong positive or negative externalities across neighboring countries. </p>

TITLE: Global Database of Shared Prosperity,PAGEID: 2173f4e8-b9c7-eb11-bacc-000d3a5a1a58,SNIPPET: <p>The World Bank Group’s goal of promoting shared prosperity has been defined as fostering income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the welfare distribution in every country, and is measured by annualized growth in average real per capita consumption or income of the bottom 40 per cent. At the outset, other details for constructing this indicator were left for countries to decide, resulting in a lack of comparability between countries if they chose different time-periods or databases when making their estimates.</p>
<p>In response to the rising demand for cross-country comparisons, the World Bank Group established a process for measuring shared prosperity in an internationally comparable way, addressing issues such as the choice of time period and the selection of databases for computing the indicator in order to produce numbers that would be relatively comparable across countries.</p>
<p>As a result of these efforts, the World Bank Group has developed the Global Database of Shared Prosperity  - a collection of comparable shared prosperity data from 93 countries circa 2011-2016.</p>
