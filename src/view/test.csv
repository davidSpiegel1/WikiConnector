TITLE: Japan - Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database 2014,PAGEID: ffbe1231-560b-ec11-b6e6-000d3a5bda46,SNIPPET: Financial inclusion is critical in reducing poverty and achieving inclusive economic growth. When people can participate in the financial system, they are better able to start and expand businesses, invest in their children’s education, and absorb financial shocks. Yet prior to 2011, little was known about the extent of financial inclusion and the degree to which such groups as the poor, women, and rural residents were excluded from formal financial systems. <br><br>By collecting detailed indicators about how adults around the world manage their day-to-day finances, the Global Findex allows policy makers, researchers, businesses, and development practitioners to track how the use of financial services has changed over time. The database can also be used to identify gaps in access to the formal financial system and design policies to expand financial inclusion.
TITLE: Japan - Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database 2011,PAGEID: 040c0540-560b-ec11-b6e6-000d3a5bdf19,SNIPPET: Well-functioning financial systems serve a vital purpose, offering savings, credit, payment, and risk management products to people with a wide range of needs. Yet until now little had been known about the global reach of the financial sector - the extent of financial inclusion and the degree to which such groups as the poor, women, and youth are excluded from formal financial systems. Systematic indicators of the use of different financial services had been lacking for most economies. <br><br>The Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) database provides such indicators. This database contains the first round of Global Findex indicators, measuring how adults in more than 140 economies save, borrow, make payments, and manage risk. The data set can be used to track the effects of financial inclusion policies globally and develop a deeper and more nuanced understanding of how people around the world manage their day-to-day finances. By making it possible to identify segments of the population excluded from the formal financial sector, the data can help policy makers prioritize reforms and design new policies.

TITLE: WDI Database Archives,PAGEID: eecf11da-f0c8-eb11-bacc-000d3a5a1c19,SNIPPET: <p><strong>BETA.</strong> The WDI Database Archives (WDI-DA) contains previous versions of the World Development Indicators database. Data are drawn from all available electronic releases going back to 1989. Metadata for this initial beta release, however, are only available from the latest WDI database. Users should exercise caution when comparing data from different versions, as the same codes have been used to reference series from different base years or different valuations of a country’s local currency. For example, the series code for constant US dollar GDP (NY.GDP.MKTP.KD), which is currently based in 2010, has been used in previous editions when the base year was 1987, 1995, 2000, and 2005. We will be working to improve the usability of the archives by harmonizing codes and names to the extent possible and adding additional metadata.</p>

TITLE: Brazil - Surveying Japanese-Brazilian Households: Comparison of Census-Based, Snowball and Intercept Point Surveys 2006,PAGEID: 6cd37184-bb0a-ec11-b6e6-000d3a5bda46,SNIPPET: This study is an experiment designed to compare the performance of three methodologies for sampling households with migrants:<br><br>- a stratified sample using the census to sample census tracts randomly, in which each household is then listed and screened to determine whether or not it has a migrant, with the full length questionnaire then being applied in a second phase only to the households of interest;<br>- a snowball survey in which households are asked to provide referrals to other households with migrant members;<br>- an intercept point survey (or time-and-space sampling survey), in which individuals are sampled during set time periods at a prespecified set of locations where households in the target group are likely to congregate.<br><br>Researchers from the World Bank applied these methods in the context of a survey of Brazilians of Japanese descent (Nikkei), requested by the World Bank. There are approximately 1.2-1.9 million Nikkei among Brazil’s 170 million population.<br><br>The survey was designed to provide detail on the characteristics of households with and without migrants, to estimate the proportion of households receiving remittances and with migrants in Japan, and to examine the consequences of migration and remittances on the sending households.<br><br>The same questionnaire was used for the stratified random sample and snowball surveys, and a shorter version of the questionnaire was used for the intercept surveys. Researchers can directly compare answers to the same questions across survey methodologies and determine the extent to which the intercept and snowball surveys can give similar results to the more expensive census-based survey, and test for the presence of biases.
TITLE: Zambia - Demographic and Health Survey 2001-2002,PAGEID: cde9918b-740c-ec11-b6e6-000d3a5bdf19,SNIPPET: The 2001-2002 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) was carried out by the Central Statistical Office and the Central Board of Health. It is a nationally representative sample of 7,658 women age 15-49 and 2,145 men age 15-59. The principal objective of the survey was to provide data to policymakers and planners on the population and health situation in Zambia. Most of the information collected in the 2001-2002 ZDHS represents updated esti­mates of basic demographic and health indica­tors covered in the 1992 ZDHS and 1996 ZDHS surveys. <br><br>The 2001-2002 ZDHS was conducted by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) and the Central Board of Health (CBoH). ORC Macro of Calverton, Maryland provided technical assistance to the project through its contract with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  Funding for the survey was sup­plied by ORC Macro  (from USAID), the Government of Japan through a trust fund managed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and through bilateral agreements between the Government of the Republic of Zambia and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA).<br><br>The primary objectives of the ZDHS are: <br>- To collect up-to-date information on fertility, infant and child mortality and family plan­ning; <br>- To collect information on health-related matters such as breastfeeding, antenatal care, chil­dren's immunisations and childhood diseases; <br>- To assess the nutritional status of mothers and children; <br>- To support dissemination and utilisation of the results in planning, managing and improving family planning and health services in the country;  <br>- To enhance the survey capabilities of the institutions involved in order to facilitate the im­plementation of surveys of this type in the future; and <br>- To document current epidemics of sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS through use of specialised modules. <br><br>Specifically, the 2001-2002 ZDHS col­lected detailed information on fertility and fam­ily planning, child mortality and maternal mor­tality, maternal and child health and nutritional status, and knowledge, awareness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually trans­mitted infections. New features of the 2001­2002 ZDHS include the collection of informa­tion on violence against women and testing of individuals for HIV and syphilis.

The study was undertaken based on the assumption that if these methods proved to be feasible with a reasonable amount of data collection for making adjustments, countries would be able to add this module to their standard household survey to produce size estimates for their key populations at higher risk of HIV infection. This would facilitate better programmatic responses for prevention and caring for people living with HIV and would improve the understanding of how HIV is being transmitted in the country.<br><br>The specific objectives of the ESPHS were:<br>1. To assess the feasibility of the network scale-up method for estimating the sizes of key populations at higher risk of HIV infection in a Sub-Saharan African context;<br>2. To assess the feasibility of the proxy respondent method for estimating the sizes of key populations at higher risk of HIV infection in a Sub-Saharan African context;<br>3. To estimate the population size of MSM, FSW, IDU, and clients of sex workers in Rwanda at a national level;<br>4. To compare the estimates of the sizes of key populations at higher risk for HIV produced by the network scale-up and proxy respondent methods with estimates produced using other methods; and<br>5. To collect data to be used in scientific publications comparing the use of the network scale-up method in different national and cultural environments.
TITLE: The Soviet Economic Decline,PAGEID: eece3d05-cac9-eb11-bacc-000d3a5a1c19,SNIPPET: <p><strong>Abstract of Paper</strong><br />
Soviet growth over 1960-89 was the worst in the world after we control for investment and capital; the relative performance worsens over time. There is some evidence that the burden of defense spending modestly contributed to the Soviet debacle. The declining Soviet growth rate over 1950-87 can be accounted for by a declining marginal product of capital with a constant rate of TFP growth. The Soviet reliance on extensive growth (rising capital to output ratios) was no greater than that of market economies like Japan and Korea, but low elasticity of substitution between capital and labor implied especially acute diminishing returns to capital compared to market economies.</p>
<p><strong>Datasets</strong><br />
All data are annual. They are given both in MicroTSP DB file format and as Lotus files. The data set is divided into two directories:<br />
"USSR", which contains specific variables for the 1928-1987 period.<br />

TITLE: Uganda - Demographic and Health Survey 2006,PAGEID: 855d22a0-660c-ec11-b6e6-000d3a5bdf19,SNIPPET: The 2006 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) is a nationally representative survey of 8,531 women age 15-49 and 2,503 men age 15-54. The UDHS is the fourth com­prehensive survey conducted in Uganda as part of the worldwide Demographic and Health Sur­veys (DHS) project. The primary purpose of the UDHS is to furnish policymakers and planners with detailed information on fertility; family planning; infant, child, adult, and maternal mor­tality; maternal and child health; nutrition; and knowledge of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. In addition, in one in three households selected for the survey, women age 15-49, men age 15-54, and children under age 5 years were weighed and their height was measured. Women, men, and children age 6-59 months in this subset of households were tested for anaemia, and women and children were tested for vitamin A deficiency. The 2006 UDHS is the first DHS survey in Uganda to cover the entire country. <br><br>The 2006 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) was designed to provide information on demographic, health, and family planning status and trends in the country. Specifically, the UDHS collected information on fertility levels, marriage, sexual activity, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods, and breastfeeding practices. In addition, data were collected on the nutritional status of mothers and young children; infant, child, adult, and maternal mortality; maternal and child health; awareness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections; and levels of anaemia and vitamin A deficiency.  <br><br>The 2006 UDHS is a follow-up to the 1988-1989, 1995, and 2000-2001 UDHS surveys, which were also implemented by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). The specific objectives of the 2006 UDHS are as follows: <br><br>- To collect data at the national level that will allow the calculation of demographic rates, particularly the fertility and infant mortality rates <br>- To analyse the direct and indirect factors that determine the level and trends in fertility and mortality <br>- To measure the level of contraceptive knowledge and practice of women and men by method, by urban-rural residence, and by region <br>- To collect data on knowledge and attitudes of women and men about sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS, and to evaluate patterns of recent behaviour regarding condom use <br>- To assess the nutritional status of children under age five and women by means of anthropometric measurements (weight and height), and to assess child feeding practices <br>- To collect data on family health, including immunizations, prevalence and treatment of diarrhoea and other diseases among children under five, antenatal visits, assistance at delivery, and breastfeeding <br>- To measure vitamin A deficiency in women and children, and to measure anaemia in women, men, and children <br>- To measure key education indicators including school attendance ratios and primary school grade repetition and dropout rates <br>- To collect information on the extent of disability <br>- To collect information on the extent of gender-based violence. <br><br>MAIN RESULTS<br><br>- Fertility : Survey results indicate that the total fertility rate (TFR) for the country is 6.7 births per woman. The TFR in urban areas is much lower than in the rural areas (4.4 and 7.1 children, re­spectively). Kampala, whose TFR is 3.7, has the lowest fertility. Fertility rates in Central 1, Central 2, and Southwest regions are also lower than the national level. Removing four districts from the 2006 data that were not covered in the 2000­2001 UDHS, the 2006 TFR is 6.5 births per woman, compared with 6.9 from the 2000-2001 UDHS. Education and wealth have a marked effect on fertility, with uneducated mothers hav­ing about three more children on average than women with at least some secondary education and women in the lowest wealth quintile having almost twice as many children as women in the highest wealth quintile. <br><br>- Family planning : Overall, knowledge of family planning has remained consistently high in Uganda over the past five years, with 97 percent of all women and 98 percent of all men age 15-49 having heard of at least one method of contraception. Pills, injectables, and condoms are the most widely known modern methods among both women and men. <br><br>- Maternal health : Ninety-four percent of women who had a live birth in the five years preceding the survey received antenatal care from a skilled health pro­fessional for their last birth. These results are comparable to the 2000-2001 UDHS. Only 47 percent of women make four or more antenatal care visits during their entire pregnancy, an im­provement from 42 percent in the 2000-2001 UDHS. The median duration of pregnancy for the first antenatal visit is 5.5 months, indicating that Ugandan women start antenatal care at a relatively late stage in pregnancy.  <br><br>- Child health : Forty-six percent of children age 12-23 months have been fully vaccinated. Over nine in ten (91 percent) have received the BCG vaccina­tion, and 68 percent have been vaccinated against measles. The coverage for the first doses of DPT and polio is relatively high (90 percent for each). However, only 64 percent go on to receive the third dose of DPT, and only 59 per­cent receive their third dose of polio vaccine. There are notable improvements in vaccination coverage since the 2000-2001 UDHS. The per­centage of children age 12-23 months fully vac­cinated at the time of the survey increased from 37 percent in 2000-2001 to 44 percent in 2006. The percentage who had received none of the six basic vaccinations decreased from 13 percent in 2000-2001 to 8 percent in 2006. <br><br>- Malaria : The 2006 UDHS gathered information on the use of mosquito nets, both treated and un­treated. The data show that only 34 percent of households in Uganda own a mosquito net, with 16 percent of households owning an insecticide-treated net (ITN). Only 22 percent of children under five slept under a mosquito net on the night before the interview, while a mere 10 per­cent slept under an ITN.<br><br>- Breastfeeding and nutrition : In Uganda, almost all children are breastfed at some point. However, only six in ten children under the age of 6 months are exclusively breast-fed. <br><br>- HIV/AIDS AND stis : Knowledge of AIDS is very high and wide­spread in Uganda. In terms of HIV prevention strategies, women and men are most aware that the chances of getting the AIDS virus can be reduced by limiting sex to one uninfected partner who has no other partners (89 percent of women and 95 percent of men) or by abstaining from sexual intercourse (86 percent of women and 93 percent of men). Knowledge of condoms and the role they can play in preventing transmission of the AIDS virus is not quite as high (70 percent of women and 84 percent of men). <br><br>- Orphanhood and vulnerability : Almost one in seven children under age 18 is orphaned (15 percent), that is, one or both par­ents are dead. Only 3 percent of children under the age of 18 have lost both biological parents. <br><br>- Women's status and gender violence : Data for the 2006 UDHS show that women in Uganda are generally less educated than men. Although the gender gap has narrowed in recent years, 19 percent of women age 15-49 have never been to school, compared with only 5 per­cent of men in the same age group.<br><br>- Mortality : At current mortality levels, one in every 13 Ugandan children dies before reaching age one, while one in every seven does not survive to the fifth birthday. After removing districts not cov­ered in the 2000-2001 UDHS from the 2006 data, findings show that infant mortality has de­clined from 89 deaths per 1,000 live births in the 2000-2001 UDHS to 75 in the 2006 UDHS. Un­der-five mortality has declined from 158 deaths per 1,000 live births to 137.
TITLE: Global Education Policy Dashboard,PAGEID: f4269de4-39e9-eb11-bacb-000d3a5aa7a5,SNIPPET: <p>Policymakers in low- and middle-income countries who are working to improve student learning often find themselves flying blind. They see the budget that goes into education and (sometimes) the learning that students come out with, but they lack information on the crucial factors in between—the practices, policies, and politics—that drive those learning outcomes. The Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD) shines a light on those hidden drivers.</p>
<p>Many countries, despite having significantly increased access to education for their children and youth, now realize that they are facing a learning crisis (World Development Report 2018). In low- and middle-income countries, despite near universal enrollment in primary school, 53 percent of children cannot read and understand a simple story by late primary age (World Bank 2019). This statistic underlines the reality that schooling is not the same as learning—even though education policy often assumes that it is (Pritchett 2013). It shows just how far off track the world is from the aspiration embodied in Sustainable Development Goal 4, of providing at least quality secondary education to all children.</p>
<p>The World Development Report 2018 argued that the learning crisis has multiple causes: poor service delivery in schools and communities, unhealthy politics and low bureaucratic capacity, and policies that are not aligned toward learning for all. To tackle the crisis and improve learning for all children, countries need to know where they stand on these three key dimensions: practices (or service delivery), policies, and politics. But providing such a systemwide overview requires better measurement. Many of these drivers of learning are not captured by existing administrative systems. And although new measurement tools capture some of those aspects well, no single instrument pulls together data on all these areas. This gap leaves policymakers in the dark about what is working and what isn’t.</p>
<p>To fill this gap, the World Bank, with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the UK’s Department for International Development, and the Government of Japan, has launched a Global Education Policy Dashboard, which measures the drivers of learning outcomes in basic education around the world. In doing so, it highlights gaps between current practice and what the evidence suggests would be most effective in promoting learning, and it gives governments a way to set priorities and track progress as they work to close those gaps.</p>

TITLE: Cambodia - Demographic and Health Survey 2014,PAGEID: b21548a0-c30a-ec11-b6e6-000d3a5bda46,SNIPPET: The 2014 Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS) is the fourth nationally representative survey conducted in Cambodia on population and health issues. It uses the same methodology as its predecessors, the 2000, 2005, and 2010 Cambodia Demographic and Health Surveys, allowing policymakers to use these surveys to assess trends over time.<br><br>The primary objective of the CDHS is to provide the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Planning (MOP), and other relevant institutions and users with updated and reliable data on infant and child mortality, fertility preferences, family planning behavior, maternal mortality, utilization of maternal and child health services, health expenditures, women’s status, and knowledge and behavior regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. This information contributes to policy decisions, planning, monitoring, and program evaluation for the development of Cambodia at both the national and local government levels.<br><br>The long-term objectives of the survey are to build the capacity of the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) of the Ministry of Planning for planning, conducting, and analyzing the results of further surveys.
TITLE: Kenya - Demographic and Health Survey 2003,PAGEID: bcfde3c7-5c0b-ec11-b6e6-000d3a5bdf19,SNIPPET: The 2003 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (2003 KDHS) is a nationally representative sample survey of 8,195 women age 15 to 49 and 3,578 men age 15 to 54 selected from 400 sample points (clusters) throughout Kenya. It is designed to provide data to monitor the population and health situation in Kenya as a follow-up of the 1989, 1993 and 1998 KDHS surveys. The survey utilised a two-stage sample based on the 1999 Population and Housing Census and was designed to produce separate estimates for key indicators for each of the eight provinces in Kenya. Unlike prior KDHS surveys, the 2003 KDHS covered the northern half of Kenya. Data collection took place over a five-month period, from 18 April to 15 September 2003.<br><br>OBJECTIVES<br><br>The 2003 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) is the latest in a series of national level population and health surveys to be carried out in Kenya in the last three decades. The 2003 KDHS is designed to provide data to monitor the population and health situation in Kenya and to be a follow-up to the 1989, 1993, and 1998 KDHS surveys. <br><br>The survey obtained detailed information on fertility levels; marriage; sexual activity; fertility preferences; awareness and use of family planning methods; breastfeeding practices; nutritional status of women and young children; childhood and maternal mortality; maternal and child health; and awareness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. New features of the 2003 KDHS include the collection of information on malaria and the use of mosquito nets, domestic violence, and HIV testing of adults. <br><br>More specifically, the objectives of the 2003 KDHS were to: <br>- At the national and provincial level, provide data that allow the derivation of demographic rates, particularly fertility and childhood mortality rates, which can be used to evaluate the achievements of the current national population policy for sustainable development; <br>- Measure changes in fertility and contraceptive prevalence use and at the same time study the factors that affect these changes, such as marriage patterns, desire for children, availability of contraception, breastfeeding habits, and important social and economic factors; <br>- Examine the basic indicators of maternal and child health in Kenya, including nutritional status, use of antenatal and maternity services, treatment of recent episodes of childhood ill­ness, use of immunisation services, use of mosquito nets, and treatment of children and preg­nant women for malaria; <br>- Describe the patterns of knowledge and behaviour related to the transmission of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections; <br>- Estimate adult and maternal mortality ratios at the national level; <br>- Ascertain the extent and pattern of domestic violence and female genital cutting in the coun­try; <br>- Estimate the prevalence of HIV in the country at the national and provincial level and use the data to corroborate the rates from the sentinel surveillance system.
TITLE: Services in the trans-pacific partnership : what would be lost?,PAGEID: 69374b6a-bdc7-eb11-bacc-000d3a5a1a58,SNIPPET: <p>As the fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) hangs in balance, an evaluation of what it offers could inform current decisions and shape future negotiations. The TPPs services component has been hailed as one of the agreement's major accomplishments. To assess the agreement's impact on national policy in the major services sectors, we created a new public database. This database reveals that TPP commitments seldom go beyond countries' applied policies, suggesting the explicit liberalization resulting from the agreement is limited only to a few countries and a few areas. However, the TPP enhances transparency and policy certainty because parties' services commitments cover more trading partners, more sectors and are in some cases closer to applied policies than their commitments under previous agreements. Furthermore, new TPP rules, including on state-owned enterprises, government procurement and competition policy, could enhance services market access. In particular, the TPP breaks new ground in prohibiting restrictions on international data flows, while at the same time creating unprecedented obligations on all parties to protect consumers from fraud and protect privacy. These dual obligations on importing and exporting countries represent a model for regulatory cooperation that could elicit greater market opening if applied to other areas.</p>

TITLE: Lao PDR - Social Indicator Survey 2011-2012,PAGEID: 187af1b5-620b-ec11-b6e6-000d3a5bda46,SNIPPET: The Lao Social Indicator Survey 2011-12 (LSIS 2011-12) is a nation-wide household-based survey of social development indicators. It combines the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and Lao Reproductive Health Survey (LRHS) where the LRHS applied technical platform of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The LSIS is based on MICS4 platform and add-on DHS modules, for example, live birth history and the maternal mortality module.<br><br>The LSIS 2011-12 was undertaken by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Planning and Investment (Lao Statistics Bureau) in collaboration with other line ministries. UNICEF and UNFPA were the primary agencies giving financial and technical assistance to support the survey. In addition, USAID, AusAID, LuxGov, WHO, UNDP, SDC, JICA and WFP provided financial and technical input to the implementation of the LSIS.<br><br>The main purposes of LSIS are to allow continued monitoring of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to serve as a baseline for the 7th National Socio-Economic Development Plan (7th NSEDP). The survey results can also be used by the Government and development partners to prepare policies, strategies and planning to improve the social environment of people in Lao PDR, especially women and men of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) and children age under five. In addition, the survey provides key sources and references for researchers and academics to conduct further analysis and research studies in specific areas using LSIS data.
TITLE: Learning Loss COVID-19 2020-2022,PAGEID: c61660ef-b98c-ed11-81ad-000d3a32e0cf,SNIPPET: COVID-19 caused significant disruption to the global education system. A thorough analysis of recorded learning loss evidence documented since the beginning of the school closures between March 2020 and March 2022 finds even evidence of learning loss. Most studies observed increases in inequality where certain demographics of students experienced more significant learning losses than others. But there are also outliers, countries that managed to limit the amount of loss. This review consolidates all the available evidence and documents the empirical findings. Data for 41 countries is included, together with other variables related to the pandemic experience. This data is publicly available and will be updated regularly.
TITLE: Zambia - Demographic and Health Survey 2007,PAGEID: 418d2e0f-740c-ec11-b6e6-000d3a5bdf19,SNIPPET: The 2007 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) is a national sample survey designed to provide up-to-date information on background characteristics of the respondents, fertility levels, nuptiality, sexual activity, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods; breastfeeding practices; nutritional status of mothers and young children; early childhood mortality and maternal mortality; maternal and child health; and awareness, behaviour, and prevalence regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections. The target groups were men age 15-59 and women age 15-49 in randomly selected households across Zambia. Information about children age 0-5 was also collected, including weight and height. The survey collected blood samples for syphilis and HIV testing in order to determine national prevalence rates.<br><br>While significantly expanded, the 2007 ZDHS is a follow-up to the 1992, 1996, and 2001-2002 ZDHS surveys and provides updated estimates of basic demographic and health indicators covered in the earlier surveys. The 2007 ZDHS is the second DHS that includes the collection of information on violence against women, and syphilis and HIV testing. In addition, data on malaria prevention and treatment were collected.<br><br>The ZDHS was implemented by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) in partnership with the Ministry of Health, the Tropical Disease Research Centre (TDRC), and the Demography Division at the University of Zambia (UNZA) from April to October 2007. The TDRC provided technical support in the implementation of the syphilis and HIV testing. Macro International provided technical assistance as well as funding to the project through MEASURE DHS, a USAID-funded project providing support and technical assistance in the implementation of population and health surveys in countries worldwide.<br><br>The main objective is to provide information on levels and trends in fertility, childhood mortality, use of family planning methods, and maternal and child health indicators including HIV/AIDS. This information is necessary for programme managers, policymakers, and implementers to monitor and evaluate the impact of existing programmes and to design new initiatives for health policies in Zambia. <br><br>The primary objectives of the 2007 ZDHS project are:   <br>- To collect up-to-date information on fertility, infant and child mortality, and family  planning. <br>- To collect information on health-related matters such as breastfeeding, antenatal care, children’s immunisations, and childhood diseases. <br>- To assess the nutritional status of mothers and children. <br>- To support dissemination and utilization of the results in planning, managing, and improving family planning and health services in the country. <br>- To enhance the survey capabilities of the institutions involved in order to facilitate the implementation of surveys of this type in future.  <br>- To document current epidemics of STIs and HIV/AIDS through use of specialized modules. <br><br>For HIV/AIDS and syphilis in particular, the testing component of the 2007 Zambia DHS was undertaken to provide information to address the monitoring and evaluation needs of government and non-governmental organization programmes addressing HIV/AIDS and syphilis, and to provide programme managers and policy makers with the information that they need to effectively plan and implement future interventions. The overall objective of the survey was to collect high-quality and representative data on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours regarding HIV/AIDS and other STIs, and on the prevalence of HIV and syphilis infection among women and men.
TITLE: Future of Business Survey 2016-2018,PAGEID: 94618807-a35c-ec11-8f8f-000d3a362e62,SNIPPET: The Future of Business Survey is a new source of information on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Launched in February 2016, the monthly survey - a partnership between Facebook, OECD, and The World Bank - provides a timely pulse on the economic environment in which businesses operate and who those businesses are to help inform decision-making at all levels and to deliver insights that can help businesses grow. The Future of Business Survey provides a perspective from newer and long-standing digitalized businesses and provides a unique window into a new mobilized economy. <br><br><br><br>Policymakers, researchers and businesses share a common interest in the environment in which SMEs operate, as well their outlook on the future, not least because young and innovative SMEs in particular are often an important source of considerable economic and employment growth. Better insights and timely information about SMEs improve our understanding of economic trends, and can provide new insights that can further stimulate and help these businesses grow. <br><br><br><br>To help provide these insights, Facebook, OECD and The World Bank have collaborated to develop a monthly survey that attempts to improve our understanding of SMEs in a timely and forward-looking manner. The three organizations share a desire to create new ways to hear from businesses and help them succeed in the emerging digitally-connected economy. The shared goal is to help policymakers, researchers, and businesses better understand business sentiment, and to leverage a digital platform to provide a unique source of information to complement existing indicators. <br><br><br><br>With more businesses leveraging online tools each day, the survey provides a lens into a new mobilized, digital economy and, in particular, insights on the actors: a relatively unmeasured community worthy of deeper consideration and considerable policy interest.
TITLE: Banking Crisis and Exports 1980-2006,PAGEID: ad5e21ba-a50a-ec11-b6e6-000d3a5bda46,SNIPPET: For the first time since 1982, in 2009, global trade flows will not grow. According to the latest IMF projections global trade in goods and services is expected to drop by 11% during 2009 and to stagnate in year 2010. The recent collapse in exports following the unfolding of the financial crisis has generated new pressing questions about the relationship between banking crises and exports growth. Are the supply shocks due to the collapse in the banking system responsible for the falls in exports? Or is what we observe completely attributable to the demand side where we have also observed unprecedented drops particularly in developed countries? In Iacovone and Zavacka (2009) we explore these questions using data, below, from 23 past banking crises episodes involving both developed and developing countries during 1980-2000.
TITLE: Trade Costs and Facilitation 2000-2001,PAGEID: b8db6217-a50a-ec11-b6e6-000d3a5bdf19,SNIPPET: The relationships between trade facilitation, trade flows, and capacity building are complex and challenging to assess, both empirically and in implementation. This working paper measures and estimates the relationship between trade facilitation and trade flows across 75 countries in global trade, considering four important categories: Port efficiency, customs environment, regulatory environment, and service sector infrastructure. A gravity model is employed that accounts for bilateral trade flows in manufactured goods in 2000-01 between the 75 countries, using traditional factors such as GDP, distance, language, and trade areas, and is augmented by the trade facilitation measures in the four categories for each country.<br><br>The data is organized such that unit of observation is a pair of importing and exporting countries. The major sources of data are, the Commodity and Trade Database(COMTRADE) of the United Nations Statistics Division for trade data, the Trade Analysis and Information System (TRAINS) of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD) for tariff data, the World Development Indicators published by the World Bank for the data of gross national product(GNP) and per capita GNP, and 3 country surveys for trade facilitation indicator (see the data description document for detail).
TITLE: World - Estimates of Distortions to Agricultural Incentives 1955-2011,PAGEID: 3e41ead2-a40a-ec11-b6e6-000d3a5bdf19,SNIPPET: The World Bank’s research project on “Distortions to Agricultural Incentives” has produced a core database of Nominal Rates of Assistance to producers, or NRAs, together with a set of Consumer Tax Equivalents, or CTEs, for farm products and a set of Relative Rates of Assistance to farmers in 75 focus countries. This is a detailed core database. <br><br><br><br>The vast majority of the world’s poorest households depend on farming for their livelihood. In the past their earnings were often depressed by pro-urban and anti-agricultural biases of their own country’s policies. While progress has been made over the past two decades by numerous developing countries in reducing those policy biases, many trade-reducing price distortions remain intersectorally as well as within the agricultural sector of low-, middle- and high-income countries.<br><br><br><br>This project, in seeking to understand the extent, effects of and reasons behind that transformation, began by compiling new estimates of price distortions over the past half century. National country studies were undertaken in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Europe’s transition economies. They were supplemented with similar estimates and analytical narratives of policy trends in 20 high-income countries. Together those countries account for more than 90 percent of the value of global agricultural output. <br><br><br><br>The core database provides nominal rates of assistance estimates for the main individual commodities that together account for about 70 percent of the value of farm production in those countries, as well as guesstimates of the NRA for the 30 percent of farm production not covered. Also estimated is the NRA for non-agricultural tradables so as to compute a relative rate of assistance. Consumer tax equivalents are also provided for the covered products in each focus country, along with value of production and consumption at undistorted prices and of trade for each covered product and for non-covered farm products. The working paper no. 4612, available as external resources, serves as the "methodology paper" for this first database.

TITLE: Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database 2014,PAGEID: 1a7dfa2a-2de9-eb11-bacb-000d3a5aa7a5,SNIPPET: Financial inclusion is critical in reducing poverty and achieving inclusive economic growth. When people can participate in the financial system, they are better able to start and expand businesses, invest in their children’s education, and absorb financial shocks. Yet prior to 2011, little was known about the extent of financial inclusion and the degree to which such groups as the poor, women, and rural residents were excluded from formal financial systems. <br><br>By collecting detailed indicators about how adults around the world manage their day-to-day finances, the Global Findex allows policy makers, researchers, businesses, and development practitioners to track how the use of financial services has changed over time. The database can also be used to identify gaps in access to the formal financial system and design policies to expand financial inclusion.
